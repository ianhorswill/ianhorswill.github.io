I'm a game AI researcher and associate professor at Northwestern University.  I'm interested in how we
can make tools that allow game developers, artists, writers, and designers to make new kinds of interactive experiences
they couldn't otherwise make.  Much of this work involves:

* **Procedural content generation**: smart ways to make random things
* **Interactive narrative**: how to dynamically tell, adapt, or generate stories
* **Character simulation**: making characters that can engage in activities that have been previously underexplored in games, like generative dialog

Much of my focus in recent years has been on making tools that can be used by non-programmers, or at least non-specialists, on the theory that none of this stuff is useful if you have to go to grad school for 10 years to learn how to use it.  I teach a course at Northwestern, *AI and Experimental Narrative*, that teaches some of my tools to a range of students from undergraduates studying theatre to MA students in film and Ph.D. students in CS.

Most of my github repos are tools for "declarative" procedural content generation in games.  See [Logic programming resources for game devs](game-lp-resources.html).
