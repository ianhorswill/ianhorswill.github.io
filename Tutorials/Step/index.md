This is a tutorial on how to use Step (Simple TExt Planner) for text PCG.
It's used in a course for both programmers and non-programmers, so it doesn't assume prior programming knowledge.
It's lengthy because it covers a lot of ground, from hello world to Definite Clause Grammars and HTN planning.  Even so,
it's only a basic introduction.
