I'm a game AI researcher and associate professor at Northwestern University.  I'm interested in how we
can make tools that allow game developers, artists, writers, and designers to make new kinds of interactive experiences
they couldn't otherwise make.

At Northwestern, I teach CS-111, the first course in the CS major sequence, CS 376 Game Design and Development, and CS 296/296/496 AI and Experimental Narrative.

In a previous life, I was a robotics researcher.  You can read about that [here](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ian).
